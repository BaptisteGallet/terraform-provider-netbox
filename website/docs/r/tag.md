# netbox_tag (Resource)

> Tags are user-defined labels which can be applied to a variety of objects within NetBox. They can be used to establish dimensions of organization beyond the relationships built into NetBox. For example, you might create a tag to identify a particular ownership or condition across several types of objects.

## Example Usage

resource "netbox_tag" "dmz" {
    name      = "DMZ"
    color_hex = "ff00ff"
